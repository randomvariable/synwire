## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Items marked [Gap] indicate missing requirements that need spec/contract updates
- Items marked [Clarity] indicate existing requirements needing more precision
- Items marked [Consistency] indicate misalignment between documents
- Items marked [Completeness] indicate partially specified requirements
- This checklist complements `api-parity.md` (CHK001-CHK070) with deeper module-level coverage
