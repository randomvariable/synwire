# API Parity Checklist: Synwire Port

**Purpose**: Validate that spec, contracts, and data model adequately document parity with Python synwire-core public API — method-by-method signature audit plus behavioural semantics
**Created**: 2026-03-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md) | [contracts/traits.md](../contracts/traits.md) | [data-model.md](../data-model.md)
**Depth**: Rigorous | **Scope**: API surface + behavioural parity
**Audience**: Reviewer (PR) | **Timing**: Pre-implementation gate

## BaseChatModel — Trait Method Parity

- [x] CHK001 Are `generate` and `generate_prompt` methods documented as intentionally excluded or mapped to an equivalent? Python BaseChatModel exposes both; Rust contracts only define `invoke`/`batch`/`stream` [Gap, Contracts §BaseChatModel]
- [x] CHK002 Is the `bind_tools` method mapped to a Rust equivalent or explicitly scoped out? Python BaseChatModel.bind_tools returns a configured Runnable [Gap, Contracts §BaseChatModel]
- [x] CHK003 Is the `with_structured_output` method mapped or explicitly scoped out? Python BaseChatModel.with_structured_output returns a Runnable that produces structured types [Gap, Contracts §BaseChatModel]
- [x] CHK004 Is the `stop` parameter requirement specified? Python invoke/stream accept `stop: list[str]`; Rust contracts omit it [Gap, Contracts §BaseChatModel]
- [x] CHK005 Are the return type differences documented? Python invoke returns `AIMessage` directly; Rust returns `ChatResult` wrapping the message — is the mapping rationale specified? [Clarity, Contracts §BaseChatModel]
- [x] CHK006 Is the `LanguageModelInput` type union (str | list[BaseMessage] | PromptValue) mapped to Rust? Python accepts multiple input types; Rust contracts only accept `&[Message]` [Gap, Contracts §BaseChatModel]

## BaseLLM — Trait Method Parity

- [x] CHK007 Are `generate` and `generate_prompt` methods documented as intentionally excluded? Python BaseLLM.generate is the core abstract method [Gap, Contracts §BaseLLM]
- [x] CHK008 Are serialisation methods (`dict`, `save`) documented as out-of-scope or mapped? [Gap, Contracts §BaseLLM]

## Embeddings — Trait Method Parity

- [x] CHK009 Are the async variants `aembed_documents` and `aembed_query` addressed? Research.md states async/sync duality collapses to single async method — is this mapping explicitly documented per trait? [Clarity, Research §3]
- [x] CHK010 Is the `config` parameter requirement specified? Rust Embeddings trait omits `RunnableConfig` unlike other traits — is this intentional? [Consistency, Contracts §Embeddings]

- [x] CHK017 Is the `embeddings` property requirement specified? Python VectorStore exposes the underlying Embeddings instance [Gap, Contracts §VectorStore]
- [x] CHK018 Is the default `k=4` parameter documented consistently? Python defaults to k=4; Rust requires explicit k — is the deviation intentional? [Consistency, Contracts §VectorStore]

## Runnable — Trait Method Parity

- [x] CHK019 Is `pipe` method specified in the Runnable contract? Only mentioned in research.md as planned; absent from contracts/traits.md [Gap, Contracts §Runnable]

- [x] CHK041 Is the `_get_relevant_documents` abstract pattern (with underscore prefix) mapped? Python separates public interface from implementor override [Clarity, Contracts §Retriever]

## CallbackHandler — Event Hook Parity

- [x] CHK047 Are `ignore_*` properties (ignore_llm, ignore_chain, etc.) mapped? Python uses these to selectively filter callback events [Gap, Contracts §CallbackHandler]
- [x] CHK048 Are `tags` and `metadata` parameters specified on callback hooks? Python callbacks receive these for tracing; Rust contracts only pass `run_id` and `parent_run_id` [Gap, Contracts §CallbackHandler]

## Message — Type Field Parity

- [x] CHK049 Is `response_metadata` field documented? Python BaseMessage has this for provider metadata (logprobs, token counts) [Gap, data-model.md §Message]

## Behavioural Parity — Async Semantics

- [x] CHK059 Is the Python async/sync duality mapping (invoke/ainvoke → single async) documented per trait, not just generically? Research.md mentions it once but contracts don't annotate each trait [Completeness, Research §3 vs Contracts]
- [x] CHK060 Are blocking sync wrappers specified? Research.md mentions "sync wrappers via a blocking module" but no contract or data-model defines this [Gap, Research §3]

## Behavioural Parity — Error Semantics

- [x] CHK061 Are error mappings specified per Python exception type? Python raises `OutputParserException`, `ToolException`, etc. — are these mapped to specific `SynwireError` variants? [Completeness, Research §4]
- [x] CHK062 Is `return_exceptions: bool` behaviour on batch documented? Python batch can return exceptions inline; Rust batch returns `Result<Vec<...>>` which fails atomically [Gap, Contracts §Runnable]

## Behavioural Parity — Serialisation

- [x] CHK063 Are `to_json`/`from_json`/`dict` serialisation methods addressed for Message types? Python messages are Pydantic models with full serialisation [Gap, Research §5]

- [x] CHK066 Is the `ChatChunk` type fully specified with all fields? data-model.md mentions it in flow diagrams but doesn't define its structure [Gap, data-model.md]

## Scope Boundaries — Intentional Exclusions

- [x] CHK067 Is there a documented list of Python API elements intentionally excluded from the Rust port? Spec §Assumptions mentions "agents, chains-of-thought, retrieval QA chains" but doesn't list excluded methods per trait [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK068 Are Runnable advanced features (`astream_log`, `astream_events`, `with_listeners`, `get_graph`, `get_prompts`, `as_tool`) documented as out-of-scope? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK069 Are VectorStore MMR methods documented as out-of-scope? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions]
